# PersonalPortfoliaWebpage

This webpage is the culmination of the FCC Responsive Web Design course. This project taught me even more about CSS flexbox, and the usefulness of the flex container to control the overall styling. Also learnt about vh/vw for setting page sizing, and * reference to cover all styled elements on the page (useful for removing margins or padding for background colours). Passes all FreeCodeCamp unit tests.<br>
